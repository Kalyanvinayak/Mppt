## Overview

The MPPT-Solar-Optimization project is designed to maximize energy harvesting from solar panels using Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms. It includes an embedded system for the MPPT logic, a mobile application for monitoring and control, and a cloud backend for data storage and management.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

## Features

*   **Efficient MPPT Algorithm:** Implements [Specify Algorithm, e.g., Perturb & Observe, Incremental Conductance] for optimal power extraction.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides real-time data visualization of solar panel parameters (Voltage, Current, Power, Temperature) via a mobile app.
*   **Remote Control (Optional):** [Specify if any remote control features are planned or implemented]
*   **Data Logging:** Stores historical performance data in the cloud.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive mobile application for easy monitoring.

*(Please update this section with specific features of your project)*

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1.  **Embedded ESP32 Controller:**
    *   Reads data from the solar panel and sensors.
    *   Implements the MPPT algorithm to adjust the duty cycle of a DC-DC converter.
    *   Communicates with the Firebase backend (e.g., via Wi-Fi) to send data and potentially receive commands.
2.  **Firebase Backend:**
    *   Utilizes Cloud Firestore for data storage (real-time parameters, historical data).
    *   Handles authentication (if applicable).
    *   Manages data synchronization between the ESP32 and the Flutter app.
3.  **Flutter Mobile Application:**
    *   Connects to Firebase to retrieve and display real-time and historical data.
    *   Provides a user interface for monitoring the solar energy system.
    *   (Optional) Allows users to configure settings or control aspects of the MPPT controller.

*(A simple diagram illustrating the interaction between these components would be beneficial here)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Embedded Development:**
    *   PlatformIO IDE or VS Code with PlatformIO extension.
    *   ESP32 development board and necessary toolchain.
    *   [Any specific hardware components like sensors, DC-DC converters, etc.]
*   **Flutter App Development:**
    *   Flutter SDK (Specify version if critical, e.g., Flutter 3.x.x)
    *   Dart SDK
    *   Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extension.
    *   An Android/iOS device or emulator.
*   **Firebase:**
    *   A Google Firebase account.
    *   Firebase CLI installed and configured.

*(Add any other general prerequisites)*

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Embedded (ESP32 MPPT Controller)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MPPT-Solar-Optimization.git
    cd MPPT-Solar-Optimization/embedded
    ```
2.  **Hardware Setup:**
    *   Connect the solar panel, sensors (voltage, current, temperature), and DC-DC converter to the ESP32 as per your circuit design.
    *   [Add a link to a schematic or provide detailed connection instructions if available]
3.  **Configure Wi-Fi & Firebase Credentials:**
    *   Update `embedded/src/main.c` (or a dedicated config file) with your Wi-Fi SSID, password, and Firebase project details.
    *   *(Security Note: Consider using a more secure way to store credentials, e.g., environment variables or a separate, non-committed config file for sensitive data.)*
4.  **Build and Upload:**
    *   Open the `embedded` folder in PlatformIO.
    *   Build the project: `platformio run`
    *   Upload the firmware to the ESP32: `platformio run --target upload`
    *   Monitor serial output (optional): `platformio device monitor`

#### 2. Firebase Backend

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project or use an existing one.
2.  **Set up Firestore:**
    *   Enable Cloud Firestore in your Firebase project.
    *   (Optional) Start in test mode or configure initial security rules. The `firebase/firestore.rules` file in this repository provides a starting point.
3.  **Register your App (for Flutter):**
    *   In the Firebase project settings, add an Android app (and/or iOS app).
    *   Follow the instructions to download the `google-services.json` file for Android (and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS).
4.  **Deploy Firestore Rules:**
    *   Ensure you have the Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`).
    *   Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
    *   Navigate to the `firebase` directory: `cd ../firebase` (if you are in `embedded`) or `cd firebase` (from root).
    *   Deploy the rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
    *   (Optional) Deploy other Firebase configurations if defined in `firebase.json`.

#### 3. Flutter Mobile App (`flutter_mppt_app`)

1.  **Navigate to the app directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../flutter_mppt_app # If you are in the firebase directory
    # or
    # cd MPPT-Solar-Optimization/flutter_mppt_app # From the project root
    ```
2.  **Place Firebase Configuration File:**
    *   Place the `google-services.json` file (downloaded from Firebase console) into the `flutter_mppt_app/android/app/` directory.
    *   For iOS, place `GoogleService-Info.plist` into `flutter_mppt_app/ios/Runner/`.
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  **Run the App:**
    *   Ensure an emulator is running or a device is connected.
    *   ```bash
      flutter run
      ```

*(Please review and update these setup instructions with project-specific details, commands, and configurations.)*

## Usage

1.  **Power On:** Ensure the ESP32 controller is powered and connected to the solar panel setup.
2.  **Network:** Verify the ESP32 is connected to your Wi-Fi network and can communicate with Firebase.
3.  **Launch Mobile App:** Open the MPPT Solar Optimization app on your mobile device.
4.  **Monitor Data:** The dashboard should display real-time data from the solar panel, such as:
    *   Panel Voltage (V)
    *   Panel Current (A)
    *   Power Output (W)
    *   Temperature (°C)
    *   MPPT Algorithm Status
5.  **View Historical Data:** [Describe how to access historical data if implemented]
